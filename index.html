    <h2 id="Bio">Biography</h2><hr>
    <p>Sorry I haven't introduced myself&#9786&#9786 </p><p>My name is <strong>Matthew Esther</strong> , I am a native of Ibadan in Oyo state and was also born in Ibadan on the 26th of December,1998. I am the only female child and i have 3 wonderful siblings.I went to <b>MIRACLE INT SCHOOL</b> for my primary education,from there i went to <b>SAINT ANNES SCHOOL,MOLETE IB</b> for my secondary school education where i met the most amazing person in my life!, so after my secondary school education,i couldn't further my education and i had to work for a while.During those times,i learnt how to make bags, i learnt makeup and i also learnt about life on the street&#9787, so after all the ups and downs, i gained admission to study <b>Geology</b> at the <strong>UNIVERSITY OF IBADAN</strong>.</p>
    <p>From a young age, I was captivated by the world around me, constantly questioning, observing and absorbing knowledge.
      My insatiable curiosity was nurtured by my family, who always encouraged me to explore my interests.

  <section aria-label="My Hobbies">
    <h2>Passion and Hobbies</h2><hr>
    <p>When I was much younger, I used to like travelling,playing football,watching movies and i also enjoy cooking too but now as a student my hobbies are reading books,surfing the internet,writing codes and that's all&#9787</p>
    <blockquote><cite>I used to think that being a student gives you the luxury of doing all the things you want to do but then being a Uite and an AltSchooler has made me see things in a new light, Student life has different shades of shege!!</cite></blockquote>
<p>Beyond the classroom, I found interest in getting to know about tech and the huge money that comes with being a tech sis and as i have  said earlier, I am studying Geology which is basically the study of Earth and the processes that have shaped it.
Right from time, I have loved working on a computer i always get strucked when i see young people working or doing anything on their computers &#9786 and that was when my interest for going into tech surfaced..I wanted to be able to make things happen with my computer,i wanted to be able to bring my ideas to life
which brings me to talking about <b>ALT SCHOOL</b> and my life as an AltSchooler.</p>
